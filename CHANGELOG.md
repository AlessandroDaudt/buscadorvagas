## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Configurable Alessandro Luis Daudt candidate profile, search preferences, salary benchmarks
  and structured master resume.
- SQLAlchemy/Alembic persistence for jobs, snapshots, analyses, LLM usage, documents,
  notifications, applications and search runs, with SQLite/PostgreSQL support.
- Extensible Greenhouse/Lever/TinyFish connectors, normalization, explainable deduplication,
  geographic filters and deterministic-plus-structured-LLM scoring.
- Salary estimates, signed Telegram actions, traceable Markdown/DOCX/PDF document packages and
  an authenticated FastAPI dashboard with an audited application pipeline.
- Cross-platform scheduler, structured logging, metrics, dependency lock, production Compose
  stack and CI security/build checks.

### Security
- Added SSRF-safe HTTP validation, prompt-injection boundaries, request limits, Argon2 panel
  authentication, CSRF/Host/CSP controls and secret-safe logs/configuration.
- Automatic job application remains explicitly unsupported.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- Job discovery search query is now config-driven: `candidate.search_seniority`
  / `candidate.search_keywords` in `config.json` shape the `site:<domain>`
  query sent to TinyFish per company. Empty/absent falls back to the previous
  hardcoded senior/staff ML/DS terms, so existing configs behave identically.
  Closes #24.

### Fixed
- `job_hunt/__init__.py` `__version__` re-synced with `pyproject.toml` (had
  drifted to a stale `0.4.1` across the last two releases).

## [0.4.3] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- MCP tools now ship full metadata: per-tool `ToolAnnotations` (title, readOnly/
  destructive/idempotent/openWorld hints), per-parameter descriptions via
  `Annotated[..., Field(...)]`, and structured output schemas (FastMCP auto).
  Improves registry quality scoring and host UX.

### Changed
- `mcp` extra now requires `mcp>=1.9` (ToolAnnotations support).

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-05

> Note: 0.4.1 was recorded here but never uploaded to PyPI (latest there was 0.4.0);
> 0.4.2 supersedes it everywhere (PyPI, MCP registries).

### Added
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker + `Typing :: Typed` and explicit Python 3.11/3.12/3.13
  classifiers on PyPI.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — checklist including the drafts-only invariant.
- README: `mcp-name` ownership marker (Official MCP Registry) and registry-status line.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- CI hardening: Python 3.13 in the test matrix, pip caching, and a `gitleaks`
  secret-scan job.
- Formal test scaffold: `pytest.ini` and a shared `conftest.py` (`fake_llm`,
  `clean_env`, `sample_config`, `sample_job` fixtures).
- Coverage gate (`--cov=job_hunt`, `fail_under = 85`) plus a mocked test suite
  raising coverage from ~36% to ~90%.
- `mypy` type checking with `job_hunt/` fully annotated; enforced in CI.
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request).
- `skills/autopilot-jobhunt/SKILL.md` — a Claude Code usage skill that drives the hunt
  via the MCP tools.
- MCP registry manifests: `server.json` (official MCP Registry) and `smithery.yaml`.
- `autopilot mcp` subcommand to launch the stdio MCP server from the installed console
  script.
- `autopilot-jobhunt` console-script alias (== the PyPI distribution name) so
  MCP-registry runners that derive the command from the package name resolve
  correctly.
- `docs/` guide set: install, providers, API keys, scanning, integrations, MCP,
  config/scoring, troubleshooting, and a testing checklist.
- `SECURITY.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, and this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed
- `job_hunt/__init__.py` `__version__` corrected from a stale `0.1.0` to track the
  packaged version.

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- `glama.json` for Glama MCP ownership/indexing and a Glama quality badge.
- `Dockerfile` and OCI image labels for the Glama MCP listing and ghcr package linking.
- Demo GIF and star CTA in the README.
- `LOG_LEVEL` env honored for console verbosity.

### Changed
- Scanner always saves results to CSV and logs a provider-aware startup line.

## [0.3.1]

### Fixed
- Compose `config.json` and `.env` correctly (placeholder guard so the default `.env`
  template no longer clobbers real config values).
- `export` works without API keys (reads local scan state only).
- Added per-request timeouts to OpenRouter and Anthropic calls.
- Handle both dict and list JSON shapes from the Claude CLI output.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- `claude_cli` LLM provider (score/draft via the local `claude` CLI, no API key).

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- pip-install workflow with `autopilot init` scaffolding.
- Structured logging and CSV fallback when Telegram send fails.
- Anthropic/Claude as an optional LLM provider.
- `SETUP.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

### Changed
- Renamed the package and repository to `autopilot-jobhunt`.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial open-source release: nightly careers-page scan, LLM resume scoring,
  Telegram alerts, and on-demand resume + cover-letter drafting.
